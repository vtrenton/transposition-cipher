# Transposition Cipher

The goal of this program is to map a set of characters in a grid, strip the spaces and then flip the x and y axis. This will transpose the chars to which will create a cipher text. Very simple cryptography. I refactored this to use a struct instead of just pure functions but i keep both approaches here since they both seem to work.
